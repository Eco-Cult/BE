This is the Backend Repository for Carbcon Web App

The repository has Javascript logs for the connection to AWS host server. The EC2 instance is used to host the web a
NodeJs is implemented for security purposes. It will help with scalibility for the app. The event-driven architecture 
processes multiple concurrent requests efficiently without clogging the RAM. 

The future goal for a multi-platform application, lesser loading and response time is acheived by this framework. 
One of our endgoal is to have no downtime for the app. And NodeJs will help us acheive that. 


For iteration 3, the applicaton has been hosted on Digital Ocean. The domain name is CARBCON.tech 
A similar database structure has been designed on this hosting service to fulfill Carbcons' requirements. The web app is secured by an active SSL certificate. The
application has been deployed by using a set of instructions to prevent Cross-Site Scrypting (XSS). This helps with keeping our services integrial and authentic. 


The backend deployment is documented in form of a PDF, which has step-by-step procedure of the EC2 instance setup and the NodeJs interaction.
